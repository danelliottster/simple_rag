# simple_rag
A RAG implementation with base functionality meant to be self-hosted on a machine with modest resources.

# Introduction

The popular, publically-available, open-source RAG implementations which are available for self-hosting are rediculously overpowered.
Here we have a RAG implementation desgined for minimal functionality.
